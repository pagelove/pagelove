- **Microdata Extraction**: Automatic extraction of HTML microdata and conversion to JSON-LD
- **Multi-host Support**: Host header-based routing with complete isolation
- **Resource Budgets**: Configurable operation, memory, and time limits per host
- **ETag Support**: Generation-based ETags for concurrency control
- **Conditional Requests**: If-None-Match and If-Match headers
